        Material is the metaphor.\n\n
        A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion.
        The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet
        technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n
        Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality.
        The flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supersede those in the
        physical world.\n\n
        Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n
        The foundational elements of print typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery
        guide visual treatments.\n\n
        Motion provides meaning.\n\n
        Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover.\n\n
        3D world.\n\n
        The material environment is a 3D space with x, y, and z dimensions.\n\n
        Light and shadow.\n\n
        Virtual lights illuminate the scene.\n\n
        Resting elevation.\n\n
        All material objects have a default elevation.\n\n
        Component elevations.\n\n
        Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n
        Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n
